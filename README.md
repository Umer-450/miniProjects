# miniProjects
A repo consisting of small fun developmental projects I work on to exercise my skills and experiment with.

Most of these projects are inspired by my learning in Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, and The Odin Project. Some of these are original projects I thought would be fun to try and work on.

This repository is strictly for experimental purposes. If you want to view some of my larger (more polished) projects, please have a look at the pinned ones on my profile.

I hope this can serve as a representation of my passions and a learning point for any fellow or aspiring developers hoping to gain new ideas. I would love to hear any thoughts or suggestions from viewers - I am always looking to expand my knowledge!

Best,
Umer
